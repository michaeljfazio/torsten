# Networking Layer Rewrite: Design Specification

**Date:** 2026-03-24
**Status:** Approved
**Scope:** Complete replacement of `crates/torsten-network/` internals, removing all `pallas-network` dependencies

## Motivation

The current networking layer depends on `pallas-network` for multiplexing, handshake, and several mini-protocol client implementations. This dependency is problematic:

1. **pallas-network is incomplete** — it does not fully implement all Ouroboros mini-protocols, requiring us to bypass its state machines (e.g., pipelined ChainSync uses raw `ChannelBuffer` instead of pallas's `chainsync::Client`)
2. **pallas-network is being replaced** — the pallas team considers `pallas-network` redundant and is building `pallas-network2` as a replacement, making the current API unstable
3. **Correctness gaps** — pallas uses an incorrect SDU payload size (65,535 vs Haskell's 12,288 for TCP), doesn't handle direction bit flipping correctly for duplex connections, and has other subtle wire-format differences from the Haskell reference
4. **Hybrid architecture** — the current codebase is part pallas, part custom (N2C server, TxSubmission2, PeerSharing are custom; handshake, multiplexer, BlockFetch, KeepAlive use pallas). This creates maintenance burden and inconsistent patterns.

A ground-up rewrite aligned to the Haskell reference implementation gives us full control, correct wire-format behavior, and no upstream dependency risk.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Full rewrite, one shot | Clean break, no legacy shims or migration complexity |
| Pallas deps | Zero pallas imports in torsten-network | Eliminates version coupling; our primitives crate wraps what we need |
| Multiplexer | Exact wire format, idiomatic Rust internals | Match Haskell on the wire (12,288 SDU, direction bits), use tokio channels internally |
| State machines | Runtime enum with debug assertions | ChainSync pipelining makes type-states impractical; runtime checks are sufficient |
| Connection lifecycle | Full Haskell parity including simultaneous open | Production mainnet requires correct duplex and connection merging |
| Protocol versions | N2N V14-V15, N2C V16-V23 | Matches production cardano-node 10.x; skip experimental Peras (V16 N2N) |
| Testing | Unit + conformance wire traces + live testnet | Wire trace replay catches the subtle encoding bugs that have bitten us before |

## Architecture

Four clean layers, each independently testable:

```
Layer 4: Connection Manager  (lifecycle, simultaneous open, warm/hot promotion)
Layer 3: Mini-Protocols      (ChainSync, BlockFetch, TxSubmission2, etc.)
Layer 2: Multiplexer         (segmentation, fairness, ingress/egress queues)
Layer 1: Bearer              (TCP streams, Unix sockets)
```

Each layer only depends on the one below it. Mini-protocols are independent of each other. The connection manager orchestrates which protocols run on which connections.

## Layer 1: Bearer

Thin async transport abstraction.

### Bearer Trait

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Bearer: Send + 'static {
    async fn read_exact(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), BearerError>;
    async fn write_all(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<(), BearerError>;
    async fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<(), BearerError>;
    async fn close(&mut self) -> Result<(), BearerError>;
    fn sdu_size(&self) -> usize;
    fn batch_size(&self) -> usize;
}
```

### Bearer Types

| Bearer | SDU Size | Batch Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| TCP | 12,288 | 131,072 | `TCP_NODELAY=false` (Nagle enabled — mux egress batching handles coalescing, so Nagle cooperates rather than conflicts), `SO_KEEPALIVE=true` (60s), 131KB read buffer. Values confirmed from `ouroboros-network/network-mux/src/Network/Mux/Bearer.hs` |
| Unix | 32,768 | 32,768 | For N2C connections |
| Mock | configurable | configurable | For testing — replay captured wire traces |

The trait abstraction enables conformance testing with pre-recorded SDU sequences via the mock bearer.

## Layer 2: Multiplexer

One mux instance per connection, managing all mini-protocols.

### SDU Wire Format

```
Bytes 0-3:  transmission_time  u32 BE  (microseconds, monotonic clock)
Bytes 4-5:  protocol_and_dir   u16 BE  (bit 15 = direction, bits 0-14 = protocol number)
Bytes 6-7:  payload_length     u16 BE  (0..=sdu_size)
Bytes 8..:  payload            [u8; payload_length]
```

**Direction bit semantics:**
- Bit 15 = 0: InitiatorDir (sent by TCP initiator)
- Bit 15 = 1: ResponderDir (sent by TCP responder)
- On ingress, the direction is **flipped** before dispatch — data sent as InitiatorDir by the remote is delivered to the local ResponderDir handler, and vice versa

### Internal Architecture

Three tokio tasks per mux:

1. **Ingress task** — reads SDUs from bearer, flips direction bit, dispatches payload to per-protocol ingress queues. Enforces per-protocol byte limits; exceeding tears down the connection (`IngressQueueOverRun`, matching Haskell).

2. **Egress task** — drains from shared egress queue in round-robin order. Each protocol can have at most one pending write at a time (fairness). Messages exceeding `sdu_size` are segmented: one chunk is written, the remainder re-enqueued at the back so other protocols get a turn. Batches up to 100 SDUs or `batch_size` bytes per `write_all` call.

3. **Control task** — monitors bearer errors, protocol violations, shutdown signals. Propagates to all channels and bearer.

### MuxChannel

Per-protocol handle provided to protocol handlers:

```rust
pub struct MuxChannel {
    protocol_id: u16,
    direction: Direction,
    egress_tx: mpsc::Sender<Bytes>,     // Send complete messages; egress task segments
    ingress_rx: mpsc::Receiver<Bytes>,  // Receive reassembled complete messages
}

impl MuxChannel {
    pub async fn send(&self, msg: &[u8]) -> Result<(), MuxError>;
    pub async fn recv(&mut self) -> Result<Bytes, MuxError>;
    pub fn try_recv(&mut self) -> Result<Option<Bytes>, MuxError>;
}
```

### Message Framing

The mux operates **below** the CBOR layer — it provides a reliable byte stream per `(protocol_id, direction)` pair. The mux itself does NOT know about CBOR message boundaries.

**Egress:** Each protocol `send()` call writes exactly one complete CBOR message. The egress task segments this into SDU-sized chunks, interleaving with other protocols.

**Ingress:** The ingress task appends incoming SDU payloads to a per-`(protocol_id, direction)` byte buffer (bounded by the ingress queue byte limit). The protocol codec layer reads from this buffer and performs incremental CBOR decoding to find message boundaries. This matches the Haskell architecture where `Network.Mux.Ingress` provides a byte stream and the `typed-protocols` codec layer handles CBOR framing.

The `MuxChannel::recv()` method performs the CBOR boundary detection: it accumulates bytes from the ingress buffer and attempts to decode a complete CBOR value. The decode must verify **exact consumption** — if trailing bytes remain after a successful decode, they belong to the next message and are retained in the buffer. This is equivalent to Haskell's `cborg` incremental decoder (`runGetOrThrow`).

### Reserved Protocol IDs

Protocol ID 1 is reserved (historically for DeltaQ, never implemented). The ingress task must silently discard any data received on protocol ID 1 rather than treating it as an error.

### Egress Backpressure

Each protocol's egress `mpsc::Sender` has a bounded capacity (default 32 messages). When the channel is full (bearer write is slower than protocol output), `send()` blocks the protocol task, providing natural backpressure. This prevents unbounded memory growth when the network is slow.

### Channel Lifecycle

When a protocol task exits (sends MsgDone and drops its `MuxChannel`):
1. The egress task detects the closed sender via `recv()` returning `None`
2. It drains any remaining queued messages for that protocol (ensuring MsgDone is sent on the wire)
3. It removes the protocol from the round-robin schedule
4. The ingress task detects the closed receiver and discards any further data for that protocol

### Ingress Queue Byte Limits

| Protocol | Limit | Derivation |
|---|---|---|
| ChainSync | 462,000 | `highMark(300) * 1400 * 1.1` |
| BlockFetch | 23,068,694 | `max(10*2097154, 100*90112) * 1.1` |
| TxSubmission2 | 65,536 | Bounded by max tx size |
| KeepAlive | 1,408 | `1280 * 1.1` |
| PeerSharing | 5,760 | `4 * 1440` |
| N2C protocols | 4,294,967,295 | Effectively unlimited (local) |

## Layer 3: Mini-Protocols

### Handshake (Protocol ID 0)

Runs through the mux as the first mini-protocol exchange.

**State machine:** `StPropose → StConfirm → StDone`

**Wire format:**
```
MsgProposeVersions = [0, { version_number => version_data }]
MsgAcceptVersion   = [1, version_number, version_data]
MsgRefuse          = [2, refuse_reason]
MsgQueryReply      = [3, { version_number => version_data }]

refuse_reason = [0, [*version_number]]           // VersionMismatch
              / [1, version_number, text]         // HandshakeDecodeError
              / [2, version_number, text]         // Refused
```

**N2N version data** (V14-V15, CBOR list of 4):
```
[network_magic: u32, initiator_only: bool, peer_sharing: 0|1, query: bool]
```

**Acceptance logic** (matching Haskell):
- `network_magic`: must match exactly — refuse if different
- `initiator_only`: take `min` (either side initiator-only → unidirectional)
- `peer_sharing`: AND (both must enable)
- `query`: OR (either side can request)

**N2C version data:** `[network_magic: u32, query: bool]`
N2C version numbers have bit 15 set: V16=32784, V17=32785, ..., V23=32791.

**Concurrent connection deduplication:** The connection manager maintains a `HashMap<SocketAddr, ConnectionState>` protected by a `tokio::sync::Mutex`. Before initiating an outbound connection, it checks for an existing entry for that peer. If one exists (inbound in progress, or already connected), the outbound request either waits for the inbound handshake (simultaneous open) or reuses the existing connection. This prevents duplicate connections to the same peer when multiple promotion requests arrive concurrently.

**Simultaneous open:** Handled at the connection manager level (not the handshake layer). When `acquireOutboundConnection` discovers that an inbound connection from the same peer already exists in `UnnegotiatedState(Inbound)`, it does NOT open a second TCP connection. Instead, the outbound thread blocks and waits for the inbound connection's handshake to complete. Once the inbound handshake finishes:
- If the inbound negotiated **Duplex** (`InitiatorAndResponder`): the existing inbound TCP connection is reused bidirectionally. The outbound request succeeds without opening a new socket.
- If the inbound negotiated **Unidirectional** (`InitiatorOnly`): the outbound request fails with `ForbiddenConnection` — cannot reuse a unidirectional connection.
- If the inbound has terminated: the outbound proceeds to open a new connection normally.

This matches the Haskell `ConnectionManager` algorithm from `ouroboros-network/framework/lib/Ouroboros/Network/ConnectionManager/Core.hs`. There is no address-comparison tiebreaker — the protocol simply reuses the existing inbound connection when possible.

**Query mode:** When `query: true` is negotiated in the handshake, the connection exists only for version discovery. After `MsgAcceptVersion` (or `MsgQueryReply` for the responder), no protocols are started and the connection is closed immediately. This is used by tools like cardano-cli that want to discover a peer's supported protocol versions.

### N2N ChainSync (Protocol ID 2)

**State machine:**

| State | Agency | Allowed Messages |
|---|---|---|
| StIdle | Client | MsgRequestNext [0], MsgFindIntersect [4], MsgDone [7] |
| StCanAwait | Server | MsgRollForward [2], MsgRollBackward [3], MsgAwaitReply [1] |
| StMustReply | Server | MsgRollForward [2], MsgRollBackward [3] |
| StIntersect | Server | MsgIntersectFound [5], MsgIntersectNotFound [6] |
| StDone | Nobody | — |

**Wire format:**
```
MsgRequestNext       = [0]
MsgAwaitReply        = [1]
MsgRollForward       = [2, header, tip]
MsgRollBackward      = [3, point, tip]
MsgFindIntersect     = [4, [*point]]
MsgIntersectFound    = [5, point, tip]
MsgIntersectNotFound = [6, tip]
MsgDone              = [7]
```

N2N sends **headers only** in MsgRollForward, wrapped as `[era_id, CBOR_tag_24(header_bytes)]`.

**Client pipelining** (matching Haskell's `pipelineDecisionLowHighMark`):
- `low_mark = 200`, `high_mark = 300`
- goLow phase: send MsgRequestNext without waiting until `outstanding >= high_mark`
- goHigh phase: collect responses until `outstanding <= low_mark`
- At tip (peer's tip == our latest received): switch to non-pipelined single request-wait

**Server:**
- Per-peer cursor (slot + hash)
- MsgFindIntersect: walk peer's point list, find best intersection via BlockProvider
- MsgRequestNext: serve next header after cursor, or enter StMustReply waiting for block announcement via broadcast channel
- StMustReply timeout: randomized between 135-911 seconds (matching Haskell). On timeout, the peer is considered stale and the connection may be demoted.
- Rollback: send MsgRollBackward when chain rolled back past cursor

### N2N BlockFetch (Protocol ID 3)

**State machine:**

| State | Agency | Allowed Messages |
|---|---|---|
| BFIdle | Client | MsgRequestRange [0], MsgClientDone [1] |
| BFBusy | Server | MsgStartBatch [2], MsgNoBlocks [3] |
| BFStreaming | Server | MsgBlock [4], MsgBatchDone [5] |
| BFDone | Nobody | — |

**Wire format:**
```
MsgRequestRange = [0, point, point]
MsgClientDone   = [1]
MsgStartBatch   = [2]
MsgNoBlocks     = [3]
MsgBlock        = [4, block]
MsgBatchDone    = [5]
```

Blocks are sent as `[era_id, CBOR_tag_24(block_bytes)]`. Server streams blocks sequentially within a batch. Client supports batch-level pipelining.

Server enforces configurable max slot range (default 2160, matching k) AND max block count per range (default 100, matching `blockFetchPipeliningMax`). The block count cap prevents Byron-era slot density from overwhelming the server.

### N2N TxSubmission2 (Protocol ID 4)

Pull-based protocol — **server drives** (inverted agency).

**State machine:**

| State | Agency | Allowed Messages |
|---|---|---|
| StInit | Client | MsgInit [6] |
| StIdle | **Server** | MsgRequestTxIds [0], MsgRequestTxs [2] |
| StTxIds(Blocking) | Client | MsgReplyTxIds [1] (non-empty), MsgDone [4] |
| StTxIds(NonBlocking) | Client | MsgReplyTxIds [1] (may be empty) |
| StTxs | Client | MsgReplyTxs [3] |
| StDone | Nobody | — |

**Wire format:**
```
MsgInit         = [6]
MsgRequestTxIds = [0, blocking: bool, ack_count: u16, req_count: u16]
MsgReplyTxIds   = [1, [*(tx_id, size_in_bytes: u32)]]
MsgRequestTxs   = [2, [*tx_id]]
MsgReplyTxs     = [3, [*tx]]
MsgDone         = [4]
```

**Flow control rules:**
- First MsgRequestTxIds after MsgInit: `blocking=false`, `ack_count=0`
- `blocking=true` only valid when zero unacknowledged tx IDs remain
- MsgDone only valid in blocking state
- Server maintains FIFO of announced-but-unacknowledged tx IDs
- Use `HashSet<[u8; 32]>` for inflight dedup (O(1) vs current O(n))

### N2N KeepAlive (Protocol ID 8)

**State machine:** `StClient → StServer → StClient` (loop), `StClient → StDone`

**Wire format:**
```
MsgKeepAlive         = [0, cookie: u16]
MsgKeepAliveResponse = [1, cookie: u16]
MsgDone              = [2]
```

Cookie must be echoed exactly; mismatch = disconnect. Used for RTT measurement (EWMA latency). Default interval 30s. Runs when peer is warm or hot. KeepAlive is N2N only — there is no local keepalive for N2C connections.

### N2N PeerSharing (Protocol ID 10)

**State machine:** `StIdle → StBusy → StIdle` (loop), `StIdle → StDone`

**Wire format:**
```
MsgShareRequest = [0, amount: u8]
MsgSharePeers   = [1, [*peer_address]]
MsgDone          = [2]

peer_address = [0, ipv4: u32, port: u16]                           // IPv4, list of 3
             / [1, w0: u32, w1: u32, w2: u32, w3: u32, port: u16] // IPv6, list of 6
```

No hostname variant exists — DNS resolution happens at a higher layer (peer selection governor). The encoder only produces IPv4/IPv6 variants; the decoder should reject unknown tags.

Max request 255 peers. Server must not return more than requested. Only active when both sides negotiated `peer_sharing: Enabled` and connection is `InitiatorAndResponder`.

Address filtering: reject loopback, RFC1918, link-local, broadcast, unspecified, multicast, documentation ranges, CGNAT 100.64.0.0/10, IPv6 ULA fc00::/7.

### N2C LocalChainSync (Protocol ID 5)

Identical state machine to N2N ChainSync. Differences:
- Sends **full blocks** (not headers) in MsgRollForward
- Wrapped as `[era_id, CBOR_tag_24(block_bytes)]`
- No pipelining expected from N2C clients
- Ingress queue effectively unlimited

### N2C LocalTxSubmission (Protocol ID 6)

**State machine:** `StIdle → StBusy → StIdle`, `StIdle → StDone`

**Wire format:**
```
MsgSubmitTx = [0, era_id, tx_bytes]
MsgAcceptTx = [1]
MsgRejectTx = [2, [era_id, reject_reason]]
MsgDone     = [3]
```

Push-based. Validate via TxValidator, accept into mempool or reject with structured error matching Haskell's `ApplyTxErr` encoding.

### N2C LocalStateQuery (Protocol ID 7)

**State machine:**

| State | Agency | Allowed Messages |
|---|---|---|
| StIdle | Client | MsgAcquire [0]/[8]/[10], MsgDone [7] |
| StAcquiring | Server | MsgAcquired [1], MsgFailure [2] |
| StAcquired | Client | MsgQuery [3], MsgRelease [5], MsgReAcquire [6]/[9]/[11] |
| StQuerying | Server | MsgResult [4] |
| StDone | Nobody | — |

**Acquire targets:**
- `[0, point]` — SpecificPoint: validate exists between immutable and volatile tip, fail with `PointTooOld` (0) or `PointNotOnChain` (1) if not
- `[8]` — VolatileTip: always succeeds
- `[10]` — ImmutableTip: always succeeds (V16+)

**MsgReAcquire** releases current and acquires new atomically. If new acquisition fails, old state is also lost.

All 39 Shelley BlockQuery tags (0-38) supported. Results wrapped in HFC `QueryIfCurrent` success envelope `[1, result]`. QueryAnytime and QueryHardFork results unwrapped.

**Lock strategy:** Snapshot needed data under the lock and release immediately. Expensive queries operate on the snapshot, not under the lock.

### N2C LocalTxMonitor (Protocol ID 9)

**State machine:**

| State | Agency | Allowed Messages |
|---|---|---|
| StIdle | Client | MsgAcquire [1], MsgDone [0] |
| StAcquiring | Server | MsgAcquired [2] |
| StAcquired | Client | MsgNextTx [5], MsgHasTx [7], MsgGetSizes [9], MsgGetMeasures [11], MsgAwaitAcquire [1], MsgRelease [3] |
| StBusy(kind) | Server | MsgReplyNextTx [6], MsgReplyHasTx [8], MsgReplyGetSizes [10], MsgReplyGetMeasures [12] |
| StDone | Nobody | — |

**Snapshot semantics:**
- MsgAcquire captures mempool snapshot; all queries operate on it
- MsgAwaitAcquire (tag 1 from StAcquired) blocks until a new snapshot is available
- MsgGetMeasures only available when negotiated version >= N2C V20 (wire 32788)
- Track which txs have been yielded via MsgNextTx per snapshot

## Layer 4: Connection Manager

### Connection States

```
ReservedOutbound → UnnegotiatedConn(Outbound) → OutboundIdle(Uni|Duplex) ─┐
                                                                           ├→ DuplexConn
UnnegotiatedConn(Inbound) → InboundIdle(Uni|Duplex) ─────────────────────┘

Any state → Closed (on error/shutdown)
```

### Core Responsibilities

**Outbound:** Governor requests connection → reserve slot → TCP connect (10s timeout) → start mux → handshake (30s timeout) → validate magic → OutboundIdle → notify governor for promotion.

**Inbound:** TCP listener accepts → rate-limit check (per-IP token bucket) → global limit check → start mux → receive handshake → validate magic → InboundIdle → notify governor.

**Simultaneous open:** Detected when outbound handshake receives MsgProposeVersions (tag 0) instead of MsgAcceptVersion (tag 1). Resolution: connection where lower address `(IP, port)` is the initiator survives; other is closed. Surviving connection becomes DuplexConn.

### Connection Limits

| Limit | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `max_inbound` | 100 | Total inbound connections |
| `max_outbound` | 20 | Total outbound connections |
| `per_ip_rate` | 5/min | Rate limit per source IP |
| `handshake_timeout` | 30s | Time to complete handshake |
| `connect_timeout` | 10s | TCP connect timeout |

### Protocol Orchestration

Connection handler starts/stops protocol tasks based on peer temperature:

| Temperature | Protocols |
|---|---|
| Cold | None |
| Warm | KeepAlive (client + server) |
| Hot | ChainSync + BlockFetch + TxSubmission2 + KeepAlive + PeerSharing (if negotiated) |

**Promotion warm → hot:** Start protocol client/server tasks with mux channel handles.
**Demotion hot → warm:** Send MsgDone on ChainSync, BlockFetch, TxSubmission2. KeepAlive continues.
**Demotion warm → cold:** Send KeepAlive MsgDone. Shut down mux. Close bearer.

### Shutdown Coordination

Each protocol task holds a `CancellationToken`. On demotion or error:
1. Cancel all protocol tasks
2. Tasks detect cancellation, send MsgDone if they have agency
3. Wait up to 5s for graceful shutdown
4. Force-close mux and bearer if tasks haven't exited

## Peer Manager & Governor

### Peer Manager

Pure state container. Per-peer state:

```rust
pub struct PeerInfo {
    address: SocketAddr,
    source: PeerSource,              // DNS, Topology, LedgerState, PeerSharing
    state: PeerTemperature,          // Cold, Warm, Hot
    negotiated_version: Option<u16>,
    diffusion_mode: Option<DiffusionMode>,
    peer_sharing: Option<PeerSharingMode>,
    latency: EwmaLatency,
    bytes_received: u64,
    blocks_served: u64,
    reputation: f64,                 // 0.0 - 1.0
    failure_count: u32,
    last_failure: Option<Instant>,
    failure_decay_timer: Instant,
    last_connected: Option<Instant>,
    last_activity: Option<Instant>,
    promoted_at: Option<Instant>,
}
```

**Failure count decay:** Background timer halves `failure_count` every 5 minutes for all peers.

**Address filtering:** Reject loopback, RFC1918, link-local, broadcast, unspecified, multicast, documentation ranges, CGNAT 100.64.0.0/10, IPv6 ULA fc00::/7.

### Governor

Periodic decision loop (1-2 second tick). Targets matching Haskell's `PeerSelectionTargets`:

```rust
pub struct PeerTargets {
    pub root_peers: usize,
    pub known_peers: usize,                    // default 100
    pub established_peers: usize,              // default 10
    pub active_peers: usize,                   // default 5
    pub known_big_ledger_peers: usize,         // default 100
    pub established_big_ledger_peers: usize,   // default 5
    pub active_big_ledger_peers: usize,        // default 3
}
```

**Decision loop per tick:**
1. Count peers by temperature
2. known < target → trigger discovery (DNS, ledger, peer sharing)
3. established < target → promote cold → warm
4. active < target → promote warm → hot
5. active > target → demote hot → warm
6. established > target → demote warm → cold
7. Churn: every 10-20 minutes, rotate a random hot peer to warm and promote a different warm peer

### Peer Discovery

1. **Topology file** — static peers, always re-promoted (root peers)
2. **DNS** — SRV and A/AAAA records from topology
3. **Ledger-based** — SPO relay addresses from `pool_params`, after `useLedgerAfterSlot`
4. **Peer sharing** — request from hot connections with peer sharing enabled

### Block Fetch Decision Logic

- Download queue of block ranges from ChainSync headers
- Select lowest-latency peer that has the block
- Distribute ranges across peers for parallel fetch
- Retry failed ranges on alternative peers
- Respect `blockFetchPipeliningMax` (default 100)

## Error Handling

### Error Hierarchy

```rust
pub enum NetworkError {
    Bearer(BearerError),          // I/O errors, timeouts
    Mux(MuxError),                // Header errors, queue overruns
    Handshake(HandshakeError),    // Magic mismatch, version mismatch, decode errors
    Protocol(ProtocolError),      // Agency violations, invalid messages, state violations
    Connection(ConnectionError),  // Limits, rate limiting, simultaneous open conflicts
}
```

### Error Severity

- `IngressQueueOverrun` → tear down connection (protocol violation)
- `AgencyViolation` → tear down connection (buggy/malicious peer)
- `NetworkMagicMismatch` → refuse and close
- `ConnectionReset` → clean up, notify governor
- `Timeout` → clean up, increment failure count

### Logging Levels

| Event | Level |
|---|---|
| Connection established/closed | `info!` |
| Handshake completed | `info!` |
| Reached tip / left tip | `info!` |
| Peer promoted/demoted | `info!` |
| Per-block MsgRollForward/MsgRequestNext | `debug!` |
| MsgRequestTxIds/MsgReplyTxIds | `debug!` |
| SDU encode/decode details | `trace!` |
| CBOR hex dumps | `trace!` |

## Metrics

Prometheus on port 12798.

**Connection:** `torsten_peers_{cold,warm,hot}`, `torsten_connections_{inbound,outbound}`, `torsten_handshakes_{completed,failed}_total`, `torsten_simultaneous_opens_total`

**Protocol:** `torsten_chainsync_headers_received_total`, `torsten_chainsync_pipeline_depth`, `torsten_blockfetch_blocks_received_total`, `torsten_blockfetch_bytes_received_total`, `torsten_txsubmission_txs_{announced,received}_total`, `torsten_peersharing_peers_received_total`

**Mux:** `torsten_mux_egress_batches_total`, `torsten_mux_ingress_queue_bytes` (per protocol)

**Latency:** `torsten_keepalive_rtt_seconds` (histogram)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- **Mux:** SDU encode/decode roundtrip, direction bit flipping, segmentation, reassembly, fairness, batching, ingress limits
- **Protocol state machines:** every valid transition, agency checks, invalid message rejection, CBOR roundtrip for every message type
- **Handshake:** version negotiation, magic mismatch, query mode, simultaneous open, N2C bit-15 encoding
- **Peer manager:** temperature transitions, failure decay, reputation, address filtering, eviction

### Protocol Conformance Tests

Wire trace replay against captured cardano-node sessions.

**Capture methodology:** Run cardano-node on preview with tcpdump, extract per-protocol sequences with dissector script, store as test fixtures in `tests/conformance/traces/`.

**Fixtures:**
```
tests/conformance/traces/
├── n2n_handshake_v14.cbor
├── n2n_handshake_v15.cbor
├── n2n_chainsync_initial.cbor
├── n2n_chainsync_rollback.cbor
├── n2n_chainsync_await.cbor

└── n2c_chainsync_block.cbor
```

**Test structure:** For outbound messages, encode and compare byte-for-byte. For inbound messages, verify correct decoding.

### Integration Tests

- In-process: full mux with mock bearer, handshake + ChainSync against canned server
- Connection manager: simulate inbound + outbound, verify simultaneous open resolution
- Live testnet: connect to preview peers, sync 100 blocks, serve LocalStateQuery, submit test transaction

### Coverage Targets

| Component | Target |
|---|---|
| Mux segment encoding | 100% |
| Protocol CBOR codecs | 100% |
| State machine transitions | 100% |
| Handshake negotiation | All version combinations |
| Connection manager | All state transitions |
| Peer manager | Core operations |

## Migration

### Dependency Changes

**Remove from Cargo.toml:**
```toml
pallas-network = { workspace = true }
pallas-traverse = { workspace = true }
pallas-crypto = { workspace = true }
```

**Add:**
```toml
minicbor = { workspace = true }  # Already in workspace Cargo.toml
tokio-util = { version = "0.7", features = ["codec"] }
bytes = "1"
```

**Keep:**
```toml
torsten-primitives = { workspace = true }
torsten-serialization = { workspace = true }
torsten-crypto = { workspace = true }
tokio = { workspace = true }
tracing = { workspace = true }
```

### torsten-node Integration

The public trait interface (`BlockProvider`, `TxValidator`, `MempoolProvider`, `UtxoQueryProvider`, `ConnectionMetrics`) is preserved. Changes in `torsten-node`:

- `node/mod.rs` — update construction to use `ConnectionManager` API
- `node/serve.rs` — trait implementations unchanged; passed via `ConnectionManager::new(config, providers)`
- `node/sync.rs` — pipelined client API changes from `PipelinedPeerClient` to `ConnectionManager::connect_outbound()` + ChainSync client

### Cutover Sequence

1. Delete all existing `src/` contents
2. Write new implementation
3. Update `Cargo.toml`
4. Update `torsten-node` integration
5. Remove `pallas-network` from workspace `Cargo.toml`
6. Build, test, verify on preview testnet

Work happens on a feature branch. Node is non-functional between steps 1 and 4.
